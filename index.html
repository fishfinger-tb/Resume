    <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
        <p>
            This website serves as an official documentation of my skills and abilities
             within the workspace. It may also serve as a window into my character and 
             why you may want to associate with me in the professional space.

             <br />
             <br />
            
            I believe my hard-working nature and creative solution development has made
            me a near-vital member in most teams I've found myself in. While my easy-going
            nature is ever-present, my seriousness serves an adequate balance - allowing me
            to be a boost to morale while prioritising a quality output.

            <br />
            <br />
            I hope to get along and work well with you.
